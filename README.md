# Acquia Cloud VM

**Note: This project is deprecated. Please use [Drupal VM](http://www.drupalvm.com/) instead.**

This project was initially created in 2014 by Jeff Geerling to closely emulate the Acquia Cloud hosting environment inside a Vagrant-powered VM.

This project has been deprecated in favor of the much more fully-featured [Drupal VM](http://www.drupalvm.com/), which can easily be configured to emulate the Acquia Cloud environment (even better than this project ever could).

If you were using Acquia Cloud VM, switching to Drupal VM is easy. Simply use the `acquia.overrides.yml` example file to make a few modifications to the Drupal VM `example.config.yml` file when you copy it and configure it just like you would configure `config.yml` for Acquia Cloud VM.
